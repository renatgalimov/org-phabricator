* Org-phabricator

  Phabricator integration with Emacs org-mode.

  Currently, includes:

  - Importing tasks
  - Exporting org files to remarkup

* Installation

  Clone the repository somewhere, for example into your =.emacs.d/= and add the repo directory into your =load-path=.

  #+NAME: .emacs
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
    ;; ...
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/org-phabricator")
    (require 'org-ph)
    ;; ...
  #+end_src

* Usage

  To export a buffer do =M-x org-export-dispatch r R=. This will export the code block

  The current version gives a very limited org-export functionality.
